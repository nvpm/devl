This  software  is  a  Neovim  plug-in for no-distraction mode to be used in the
editor.  The  distraction mode can be achieved by concentrating the editing area
in  the middle of the screen, and switching off the rest around it. By doing so,
the  impression  is  that  the  editor  is floating in a void vacuum, creating a
focusing sensation while using the editor that way.

It's  actually an expected sensation. The human eye is not capable of perceiving
the  whole  screen  width,  let alone its height. Therefore, by letting the text
area  to  occupy  the  whole screen, not only it invites writing long lines, but
also overwhelms the writer's eyes.

As  mentioned, the solution to simulate this is to force the editing area to the
middle, but how one can accomplish this by using only built-in Neovim commands?

Assuming  a  screen with dimensions "1366x76", a good fit should here is how one
could do it:

---
terminal $nvim

:set signcolumn=no
:split
:split
<c-w><c-j>
:vsplit
:vsplit
<c-w><c-l>
:vertical resize 80
:resize 35
---

After this, the layout will be something like the following:


          +---------------------------------------------------------+
          |                                                         |
          |                                                         |
          |no name                                                  |
          +---------------+------------------------------+----------+
          |               | <- cursor here      ^        |          |
          |               |                     |        |          |
          |               |                     |        |          |
          |               |                              |          |
          |               |                     h        |          |
          |               |                              |          |
          |               |                     |        |          |
          |               |                     |        |          |
          |               |<---------  w  ------Â·------->|          |
          |               |                     |        |          |
          |               |                     |        |          |
          |               |                     |        |          |
          |no name        |no name              V        |no name   |
          +---------------+------------------------------+----------+
          |--No lines in buffer--                                   |
          +---------------------------------------------------------+

In  this  case,  the  geometry of usable text area in the middle window would be
w=80 and h=35. Meaning one can write a string of 80 characters without having to
worry  about having to split it into a new line of text. On the other direction,
the  user would have 35 rows of lines to place text. Most users won't even count
those  numbers. Some of them spend a whole life without worrying about available
columns to display one single line. They take it for granted until comes the day
they  open  the  same  file in Neovim, but in a smaller screen. Them this person
realises that of that text occupies more than that screen can display nicely. As
side effects, that user ends up with a hard-to-read text.

Even  though  the  image  above is one solution, it's not yet perfect. The image
only  exploits  the  notion of layouts. A slight different set of commands could
create a totally different structure. The perfect scenario is to have the middle
window exactly or most in the middle of the screen as possible. One way of doing
is  by  having  mouse  enabled  (set  mouse=a). This way the user can center the
middle window in the screen and then start writing something.

But another problem appears when handling this task by hand. The middle window quickly has its size changed the mouse operation.
