idea nvpm-menu{

A menu-like  interfacing  will  be necessary to accomodate all the function from
nvpm  plugins,  and  display  them  in an easy way, in which the function can be
activated  by  temporary key-bindings. It's possible that this will be triggered
by a command simply called ":NVPM" without any arguments.

More information will come in due time!
