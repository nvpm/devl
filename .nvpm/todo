  * import  the  "main loop with numeric iterator" idea  from the current nvpm
  plugin. A second  iterator  must  be  created  in order go over the subnodes
  without losing the main loop count. The info from the sub-node must be taken
  and inserted into the main tree so the main loop can continue.

  * insert  the random hash inside each node (already in data structure).

  * remove    file  dependency  from  flux.  The  client  plug-ins must now be
  responsible   for   the   IO   operations.  Flux  will  only  be  a  parser.

  * Better proj loaded test variable (the old g:nvpm.data.loaded variable). A use case study must be made in order to determine the state of the tree variable.
